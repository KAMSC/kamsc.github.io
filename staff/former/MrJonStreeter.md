Mr. Streeter retired from KAMSC in June of 2011 after 24 very happy years. While no longer on the regular staff he remains available as an Outreach Consultant for KAMSC alumni issues and related services. His career in education spans 46 years and his previous bio remains below.

Jon Streeter came to KAMSC (in 1987) from Loy Norrix High School in Kalamazoo where he was the Computer Center Coordinator and teacher of Computer Science. He holds degrees in Mathematics, Music, and a Master's in Business from Western Michigan University. He also holds certifications in Business Information Systems, Computer Science, and Music.

Mr. Streeter has done independent consulting in both business and education. He pioneered many applications of technology to education in the Kalamazoo schools. He has served on the Computer Science Faculty at Western Michigan University and is the recipient of several awards for meritorious service and educational excellence.

As is the case with most staff at KAMSC, Mr. Streeter wears many hats. He has developed many of the applications still in use at KAMSC and trained the staff. In addition to offering classes that use the computer as an object of instruction, for eleven years, he served as Technology Coordinator, Network Administrator, Advisor to the Web Development Team, and fulfilled numerous administrative responsibilities including student scheduling and staffing. He serves on area technology related committees, has offered seminars at statewide conferences, and has written articles for statewide publications. His students have been highly successful in competitions.

Since 1997 Mr. Streeter has served (part time) as a College Consultant - expediting the admission process for KAMSC students and parents. In this capacity he works on a number of Outreach projects related to alumni interfacing with current KAMSC students and has visited alumni (and admissions officials) on more than 100 campuses from coast to coast.
