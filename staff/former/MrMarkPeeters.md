Science and Technology Support - at KAMSC from 1991 thru 1999 Currently employed by Comstock Public Schools as the District Technology Director. The thing I miss most about KAMSC, the students and conversations. Thing I miss the least, cleaning the HLPC and degassing solvent.I still have to change server back-up tapes, so I don't miss that. :-)
here's me last time I was on the 4th floor.
