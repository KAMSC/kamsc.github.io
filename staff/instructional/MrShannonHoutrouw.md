Mr. Houtrouw came to KAMSC in 1997 after teaching university math and computer science for nearly a decade. Houtrouw also worked as a software systems engineer for General Motors / Electronic Data Systems. He taught three summer terms in Zimbabwe, Africa. Houtrouw earned a BS in computer science from Oklahoma Christian University, and a MSE in mathematics from Harding University. His certifications are in computer science and mathematics.

Houtrouw developed the KAMSC AP Computer Science program and volunteers as KAMSC's programming teams coach-advisor. The computer teams began enjoying success in his second year and have gotten progressively better each year. CS Team victories include wins at the American Computer Science League All-Star Invitational (2003, 2004, 2014), the MACUL contests at Eastern Michigan University (2010, 2011), the Engineering and Computer Science Experience Contests at the University of Michigan-Dearborn (2008, 2011, 2014) and the ACM High School Programming Contests at Saginaw Valley State University (2003, 2005, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014), the University of Michigan-Flint (2005), Evansville University (2010, 2011), Indiana Universityâ€“Purdue University Indianapolis (2014), Miami University (2012, 2013, 2014), and Michigan State University (2013, 2014).

Houtrouw received the 2014 Air Zoo Science Innovation Hall of Fame Educator Excellence Award. In 2013 Houtrouw was recognized by the National Center for Women & Information Technology with the NCWIT Aspirations in Computing Educator Award. That same year Houtrouw was also presented the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation Joseph B. Whitehead Educator of Distinction Award.

Houtrouw has served on the steering committee of the MACUL Special Interest Group in Computer Science and has been a presenter for MACUL, for the Google sponsored CS4HS Workshops, and for the NSF sponsored Tapestry Workshops in Computer Science. He has worked as an AP consultant in Computer Science for The College Board Midwest Region and has worked as an AP Reader for the AP Computer Science Exam.
