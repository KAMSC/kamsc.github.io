Ms. Hach has a B.S. with majors in both Chemistry and Biology. She received her M.S. in Biological Sciences from Michigan State University, where her primary area of interest was plant biochemistry.

Before coming to KAMSC, Cheryl taught at Kalamazoo Central and Western Michigan University in the Chemistry Department.

Since 2001, Cheryl has been a national board certified teacher in adolescent and young adult science, with specialization in biology. She has been involved with summer teaching and educational research opportunities through Michigan State University and, most recently, the University of California - Davis.  She is also involved with MSU's GK-12 Partnership at the Kellogg Biological Station. She continues to be a member of the Executive Committee of the Michigan Science Teachers Association and is the Executive Editor of their publications.  Cheryl serves on the Internal Review Committee for the Next Generation Science Standards, assisting the State of Michigan in adoption and upcoming implementation. She is a frequent presenter at local, state and national science professional development conferences.

Cheryl is very involved with raising service dogs and will soon be raising puppy # 14 for Leader Dog for the Blind in Rochester, Michigan.  If you see Cheryl, it is likely that the new pup will be with her.

In a past life, she was a medical technologist, working with a high-risk pregnancy intervention program as well as a research group linking viral illness with adrenal functions.  Cheryl has also worked at Pfizer (Pharmacia and Upjohn) where she was employed as part of a National Institute of Health grant for the study of HIV inhibition via a kinase signalling cascade.
