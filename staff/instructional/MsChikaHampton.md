Ms. Hampton, a Kalamazoo local, brings over ten years of high school classroom experience to the position, primarily teaching chemistry, but also teaching in some of the allied physical science fields. Ms. Hampton earned her bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Kalamazoo College, and will soon complete her master’s degree at Western Michigan University in the area of Evaluation, Measurement and Research.

Ms. Hampton teaches three sections of KAMSC’s honors chemistry class in the mornings, and works with our advanced placement chemistry students in the afternoons, where she has already begun to incorporate inquiry-based laboratory experiments. In addition to her teaching experience, Ms. Hampton has an ongoing relationship with the Food Research Cooperative where she has, among other initiatives, developed agricultural science educational programming.
