In collaboration with a mentor, they develop a research proposal and, from early in the fall until the end of February, carry out the research at the mentorâ€™s work site. This research averages 6-8 hours per week after the classes at KAMSC. Milestones are measured and students participate in regular meetings, science seminars and science fair competitions.
