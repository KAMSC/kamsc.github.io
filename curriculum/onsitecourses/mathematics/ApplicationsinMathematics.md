coursename: APPLICATIONS IN MATH
description: "Applications in Mathematics is designed to be a non-traditional math class. The primary focus of the class will be problem solving in varied contexts, using mathematical modeling to describe real world events and systems, with an emphasis on computer algorithms and programming techniques. Students will work on problems in science, economics, sports, medicine, management, engineering, and social science. Graphing calculators and computers will be used extensively, as modeling tools. Problems will vary in complexity and depth, with some being open ended problem-solving activities (no single best solution, or possibly no solution at all)."
