description: "<b>A college level course</b> dealing with finite processes, sets of elements, countable phenomena (based on integersâ€”contrasted with calculus, which has to do with infinite processes and intervals of real numbers).  The mathematical topics and algorithms studied have many applications in the broad field of computer science.  Topics include combinatorial analysis, graph theory, mathematical trees, logic gates, circuits, and more."
