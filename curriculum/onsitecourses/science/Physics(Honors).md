description: "A college-preparatory honors physics course covering classical mechanics, special and general relativity, gravitation, oscillatory and wave motion, geometric optics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and nuclear physics. Lab activities include an experiment using Western Michigan University's tandem Van de Graaff accelerator. This is a mathematically rigorous experience equivalent to an introductory college-level algebra-based physics course. A research project in physics, engineering, or mathematics is required."
