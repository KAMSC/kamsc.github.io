<h3>Should I apply to the KAMSC Program?</h3>

The decision is often not an easy one. The information listed below represents a composite of most of the students in the KAMSC program but in no way represents a definitive and exclusive set of qualifiers. The items are presented as a means for you to compare student qualifications with those that fit the profile of a typical KAMSC student. If you have questions or would like further explanation on any of the below items, please contact us.

Typical students in the program have:
 - above a B average in math, science and English classes in high school
 - scores higher than 40 out of 72 on the KAMSC entrance exam

While these items are consistent with most of the students enrolled in KAMSC, there are exceptions. (For example, more than 15% of the students admitted to KAMSC earn entrance exam scores of 40 or less.) In addition to these items, the KAMSC Applicant Review Panel also considers: student responses to the application questionnaire, student writing samples, teacher recommendations and evaluations of student performance, and characteristics of success such as self-motivation and responsibility.

Please do not treat the items listed above as required standards for acceptance. They are provided for guidance purposes only.

**NOTE:** *Students must be enrolled in an Algebra I or higher level math class during their 8th grade year.*
