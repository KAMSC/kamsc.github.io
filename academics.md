All students, within the first three years of the core curriculum, participate in an intensive and guided-research-based program, developing the skills necessary to conduct scientific research. Some students become involved with long-term research projects with scientists in the community. The capstone of the KAMSC student experience is involvement in a mentorship. Seniors participate for one semester in a mentorship with a community professional at their workplace.
